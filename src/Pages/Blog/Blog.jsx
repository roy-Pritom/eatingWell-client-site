It uses an asynchronous event-driven model and is designed to build scalable network applications.ExpressJS is a web application framework for NodeJS. Thatâ€™s what mainly makes the difference between Express JS and Node JS.Nodejs is used to build server-side, input-output, event-driven apps.Express js is used to build web-apps using approaches and principles of Node.js.

It allows you to reuse some piece of code in several parts of your app.We use When we want to share the logic between other components, we can extract it to a separate function.So we create custom hook.
